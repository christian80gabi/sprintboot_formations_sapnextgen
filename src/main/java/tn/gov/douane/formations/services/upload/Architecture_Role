Let me explain it briefly.

– FileInfo contains information of the uploaded file.
– FilesStorageService helps us to initialize storage, save new file, load file, get list of Files’ info, delete all files.
– FilesController uses FilesStorageService to export Rest APIs: POST a file, GET all files’ information, download a File.
– FileUploadExceptionAdvice handles exception when the controller processes file upload.
– application.properties contains configuration for Servlet Multipart.
– uploads is the static folder for storing files.
– pom.xml for Spring Boot dependency.
